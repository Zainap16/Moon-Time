        <h1> Equality in Christianity</h1>
        <p>According to the New Testament, Christian marriage is seen as mutual love between partners. It was
          originally interpreted as submission of women and men (Eph. 5:21), however, a modern interpretation sees
          it as a submission to God, rather than man."Women are seen as equals to men and both genders serve a role
          in the family - to help the family to serve God."</p>
        <p>Genesis 1:27 states,  They were given equal tasks of ruling and subduing all creatures (Genesis 1:28). </p>
        <blockquote>
            "So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him, male and
          female he created them".
           
        </blockquote>
        <p>The equal worth of men and women—and the equality of their spiritual need—is affirmed in Galatians 3:28–29:
          “There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one
          in Christ Jesus</p>
          <p>Salvation is offered for all people, regardless of race or gender or social status, and that salvation is
            offered through Jesus Christ alone (John 14:6; Acts 4:12). In the matter of salvation, there is true gender 
            equality.<</p>
