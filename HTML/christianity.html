        According to the New Testament, Christian marriage is seen as mutual love between partners. It was
        originally interpreted as submission of women and men (Eph. 5:21), however, a modern interpretation sees
        it as a submission to God, rather than man.Women are seen as equals to men and both genders serve a role
        in the family - to help the family to serve God.

        Genesis 1:27 states, "So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him, male and
        female he created them". They were given equal tasks of ruling and subduing all creatures (Genesis 1:28).

        The equal worth of men and women—and the equality of their spiritual need—is affirmed in Galatians 3:28–29:
        “There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one
        in Christ Jesus.

        Salvation is offered for all people, regardless of race or gender or social status, and that salvation is
        offered
        through Jesus Christ alone (John 14:6; Acts 4:12). In the matter of salvation, there is true gender equality.
