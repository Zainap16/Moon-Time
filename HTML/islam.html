    <h1>Islam</h1>
    <hr>
    <a>
        The Quran, the holy book of Islam, indicates that both men and women are spiritually equal.The Quran states
        "Those who do good, whether male or female, and have faith will enter Paradise and will never be wronged;
        even as much as the speck on a date stone.”
        — Quran: 4:124
    </a>
    <hr>
    <a>
        In the Qur’an (Qur’an 49:13), God created humans from male and female, and despite
        the empirical differences among humans (based on race, gender, etc.), the Qur’an regards them as equals
        and only ranks humans based on their moral choices and piety. God created men and women from the
        same soul, as guardians of each other in a relationship of cooperation not domination.
